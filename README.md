# javascript30
I'm taking on the "30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge".
This repository tracks the progress of 30 projects from the ["JavaScript30"](https://javascript30.com/) course by ["Wes Bos"](https://github.com/wesbos).
The challenge is to build 30 different things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks, libraries, etc.).
